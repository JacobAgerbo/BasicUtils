# Basic Utility Script for Bacteria and Host-Microbe Interactions Analysis

This repository contains a basic utility script that can be used for analyzing bacteria and host-microbe interactions using omics data. It provides a set of functionalities that are commonly used in bioinformatics and can be a useful starting point for researchers working in this field.

## Features

- Data preprocessing: The script includes functions for preprocessing omics data, such as quality control, filtering, normalization, and transformation.

- Statistical analysis: It offers various statistical analysis methods for identifying differentially expressed genes, proteins, or metabolites between different conditions or groups.

- Visualization: The script includes functions for generating visualizations, such as heatmaps, volcano plots, and pathway enrichment plots, to aid in data exploration and interpretation.

- Documentation: The script is thoroughly documented, providing explanations and examples for each function to facilitate its usage and customization.

## Requirements

The script requires the following dependencies to be installed:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- R (version X.X.X)
- Bioconductor packages (e.g., limma, edgeR)
- Other Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib)

## Usage

To use the script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. At basic conda environment called `Basic_Utils` will be the foundation of these bioinformatic processes
