Description: 
    This package provides a collection of functions for basic research of host-microbe interactions, using Omics and multivariate analysis. The package includes functions for preprocessing and analyzing data, such as preprocess_data for data cleaning, normalization, and batch effect correction, and generate_pca_plot for generating PCA plots to visualize the relationships between samples. Other functions include biomarker predictions, power-analysis, group comparison, Linear mixed effect models, etc. These functions are designed to be user-friendly and flexible, allowing researchers to customize their analysis based on their specific needs.
